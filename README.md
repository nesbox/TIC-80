**TIC-80 TINY COMPUTER** - [https://tic.computer/](https://tic.computer/)

# About
TIC-80 is a **FREE** and **OPEN SOURCE** fantasy computer for making, playing and sharing tiny games.

With TIC-80 you get built-in tools for development: code, sprites, maps, sound editors and the command line, which is enough to create a mini retro game.

Games are packaged into a cartridge file, which can be easily distributed. TIC-80 works on all popular platforms. This means your cartridge can be played in any device.

To make a retro styled game, the whole process of creation and execution takes place under some technical limitations: 240x136 pixel display, 16 color palette, 256 8x8 color sprites, 4 channel sound, etc.

# Binary Downloads
You can download compiled versions for the major operating systems directly from our [releases page](https://github.com/nesbox/TIC-80/releases).

# Pro Version
To help support TIC-80 development, we have a [PRO Version](https://nesbox.itch.io/tic).
This version has a few additional features and binaries can only be downloaded on [our Itch.io page](https://nesbox.itch.io/tic).

For users who can't spend the money, we made it easy to build the pro version from the source code.

### Pro features

- Save/load cartridges in text format, and create your game in any editor you want, also useful for version control systems.
- Even more memory banks: instead of having only 1 memory bank you have 8.
- Export your game without editors, and then publish it to app stores (WIP).
