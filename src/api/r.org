#+TITLE: Embedding R in TIC-80

# Copyright © 2024 Bryce Carson

The homepage of the R langauge is https://www.r-project.org/.

Any section marked TODO indicates that the section must be edited for clarity,
or is a draft which must be completed, before publishing this literate program
to share it.

* Sectioning of the =r.c= source file
This section of the literate program tangles together all the source blocks
composing the actual C source file defining the *TIC-80* fantasy computer *R*
langauge support for writing demos, programs, and games.

Much of the *R* langauge and its implementation was inspired by a C++
implementation of Scheme (if I recall things I've read, so it's hearsay but go
ahead and research it yourself), so aspects of the Scheme *TIC-80* langauge
integration will be honoured and "Scheme" will appear in several places, though
none of it is Scheme any more.  Before a final public release this will be
changed so that no references to "Scheme" occur in the code.

** Requirements
The requirements of the integration of R in TIC-80 are briefly noted.

- TIC-80 event loop respected and not interfered with (graphical application is
  performance-sensitive).
- Initialize multiple R interpreters during the lifetime of the embedding
  application, but not simultaneously. One interpreter should be initialized
  after closing another.
- Statically built R library; no expectation of system libraries available, like
  a Fortran installation, or various headers that would be installed with Rtools
  or something on Windows.
- Memory for storage of objects limited to 126 KB; I don't think the available
  memory is limited otherwise, but R will be limited to storing 128 KB of
  objects in memory. No real expectation of disk storage or filesystem.

** The TIC-80 System
*** The C API
Every scripting langauge binding to the C API provides a method of writing
programs in scripting languages which call the C functions which /really
underly/ the game engine of the fantasy console.

Eventually, every C function defining the langauge bindings to the C
API of TIC-80---wrapping the underlying C functions of the game engine
in interpreted (or WASM-compiled) scripting languages---will call a C
function with predictable arguments to have TIC-80 finally act upon
something. As an example, see the trace function in the R
integration. The Scheme integration is just like it.  Some data types
of the scripting language's C API are created,
and---potentially---something is evaluated, then the results are
passed to the TIC-80 C API.

#+begin_comment
The following block has "yes" as the argument for noweb so that when exported
the following will quote the C source for the trace function wrapper without me
needing to copy it and update it when changes are made.
#+end_comment

#+begin_src C :noweb yes
  <<trace>>
#+end_src

**** How the trace API command is integrated with Lua
#+begin_src C
  static s32 lua_trace(lua_State *lua)
  {
  	s32 top = lua_gettop(lua);
  	tic_core* core = getLuaCore(lua);
  	tic_mem* tic = (tic_mem*)core;

  	if(top >= 1)
  	{
  		const char* text = printString(lua, 1);
  		u8 color = TIC_DEFAULT_COLOR;

  		if(top >= 2)
  		{
  			color = getLuaNumber(lua, 2);
  		}

  		core->api.trace(tic, text, color);
  	}
  	else luaL_error(lua, "invalid params, trace(text,[color])\n");

  	return 0;
  }
#+end_src

*** TODO Describe the =TIC_CORE= type; why is it used like an origin point?
In the Python and Scheme langauge integrations, within the respective
=eval*= function, a variable ~tic~ of type ~tic_mem *~ is cast to
~tic_core *~ and stored in a variable named ~core~. Was that
description difficult to follow? I think so. See the following example
block.

#+begin_example C
  tic_core core = (tic_core *)tic;
  s7_scheme *sc = core->currentVM;
  pkpy_vm *vm = core->currentVM;
#+end_example

In each, this ~core~ struct is then accessed to obtain the ~currentVM~
object (~core->currentVM~). In the Scheme integration this value is
called =sc=, like "Scheme core", and in the Python integration it is
called =vm=, like "virtual machine".

The Python integration uses a =pkpy_vm *= type, and the Scheme
integration uses a =s7_scheme *= type. In s7 Scheme =s7_scheme= is a
big struct /defining the Scheme virtual machine or interpreter/. See
[[/home/bryce/Documents/src/c/TIC-80/vendor/s7/s7.c][the struct in the sources here]]. I could not find the equivalent in
Pocketpy, but I noticed that the signature of =py_eval= in Pocketpy is
different from =pkpy_eval=, and moreover I don't see a definition of
the function in either soure tree.

The real function and nature of the =tic_core= type is not yet clear to me.

- =currentVM= is a void pointer; it is simply a pointer without a
  type, and it can point to anything useful!
- =tic_mem= is the first field of the =tic_core= struct, so a pointer
  to a =tic_mem= object also points to a =tic_core= object.

** TODO Introduction
*** Initialization of the interpreter within an embedding application
The R interpreter, like the [[https://ccrma.stanford.edu/software/snd/snd/s7.html][s7 Scheme interpreter]], needs to be initialized or
re-initialized if it isn't running when TIC-80 wants to request something (the
game source code, or a debugger entry point or a callback or something else) be
evaluated, so the program either "initialize[s] R, returning if that fails"
or reinitializes R in that subroutine.

~evalR~ is the doorway through which TIC-80 C routines and functions enter into
communion with R /as an embedded script interpreter/ within TIC-80.
Understanding how the other languages are integrated will help me integrate this
language. This is a very simple C function because nothing needs to be done
except pass its argument to ~Rf_mkString~ before passing that to ~Rf_eval~. We
can define it right now. For now the =memory= parameter can be ignored.

#+begin_src C :noweb-ref cartridge commands
  void evalR(tic_mem *memory, const char *code) {
  	setEnvironmentVariablesIfUnset();
  	if (!R_initialized_once) {
  		initR(memory, code);
  		R_initialized_once = true;
  	}
  	SEXP RESULT;
  	if (R_initialized_once) RESULT = Rf_eval(CSTR2LANGSXP(code), R_GlobalEnv);
  	#if defined ebug /* -DEBUG=ON */
  	Rprintf("%s", RESULT);
  	#endif
  }
#+end_src

Before ~R_GlobalEnv~ is available, the C symbol must be initialized by calling
~InitBaseEnv()~ and then calling ~InitGlobalEnv~, both of which are defined in
=main/envir.c= in the R sources. The declaration of ~R_GlobalEnv~ is in
=include/Rinternals.h=; ~R_GlobalEnv~ is defined as a ~SEXP~ with the modifier
~LibExtern~ (~LibExtern SEXP R_GlobalEnv;~). These functions are called in
~setup_Rmainloop~, and are called in a specific order along with many other
functions which initialize R and its behaviours and capabilities (including
arithmetic); it is very important that ~setup_Rmainloop~ is called. This
function is called automatically by calling ~Rf_mainloop~.

*** Initializing Scheme
The initScheme function takes a pointer to the *TIC-80* memory and a character
pointer to the code that Scheme should evaluate (when it's initialized). To
promote a clean room, Scheme is terminated before it is initialized through
calling the =s7_init= function coming directly from the *s7* library
and before the API is initialized; this should remove a host of errors related
to the lifetime of objects, data, and values in the object table that is managed
by the interpreter, and every time the user of *TIC-80* runs their game a fresh
interpreter is spawned to avoid the garbage that could otherwise pollute their
shiny new bug-fixes (which would introduce new bugs!). An error handling
function is defined and then a special bit of Scheme code is evaluated before
another bit is evaluated, a variable defined, and then finally the game code
loaded. A final task is to check if the function =TIC= is defined in the
Scheme LISP image by that time, and if it is then that is the "entry point"
where the interpreter is given freedom to evaluate to its hearts content and
make callbacks to the *TIC-80* fantasy computer through the API.

#+name: quotation
#+begin_src C
  static bool initScheme(tic_mem* tic, const char* code)
  {
  	tic_core* core = (tic_core*)tic;
  	closeScheme(tic);

  	s7_scheme* sc = core->currentVM = s7_init();
  	initAPI(core);

  	s7_define_function(sc, "__TIC_ErrorHandler", scheme_error_handler, 1, 0, 0, NULL);
  	/* See "set the error-hook function.scm" and pretend its a properly escaped C string. */
  	s7_eval_c_string(sc, <<set the error-hook function.scm>>);
  	s7_eval_c_string(sc, defstructStr);

  	s7_define_variable(sc, TicCore, s7_make_c_pointer(sc, core));
  	s7_load_c_string(sc, code, strlen(code));

  	const bool isTicDefined = s7_is_defined(sc, ticFnName);
  	if (!isTicDefined) {
  		if (core->data) {
  			core->data->error(core->data->data, "TIC function is not defined");
  		}
  	}

  	return true;
  }
#+end_src

#+name: set the error-hook function
#+begin_src scheme
  (set! (hook-functions *error-hook*)
  			(list (lambda (hook)
  							(__TIC_ErrorHandler
  							 (format #f "~s: ~a\n--STACKTRACE--\n~a"
  											 ((owlet) 'error-type)
  											 (apply format #f (hook 'data))
  											 (stacktrace)))
  							(set! (hook 'result) #f))))
#+end_src

Based on the requirements of *TIC-80* it seems clear that I need to define a
wrapping function to initialize *R* and pass around some information
appropriately.

*** Console evaluation
The console of the main application, when running, has an =eval= command which
can be used to evaluate source code in the scripting language of the currently
loaded cartridge. This is a good target for integrating R into TIC-80. I need to
be able to evaluate R in any context, so to be able to evaluate R in the context
of a CLI is natural to both R and TIC-80; this is where I'll start.

#+begin_comment
What is a context?
#+end_comment

The ~onEvalCommand~ function in the TIC-80 C API takes a =Console *= which is
used to retrieve access to the console. This console object is used by functions
for making the VTTY carriage return (begin a new line), retrieving the
=tic_script= object which contains pointers to the evaluation function, etc.

As a test of R working, I will print the values of ~R.version.string~ and
~R.version~ on the console, first by simply retrieving these values from R and
printing them using the C API, and then eventually printing them using the
TIC-80 API function ~trace~.

~script_config->eval~ here is the same ~void (*eval)(tic_mem* tic, const char*
code)~ defined later in [[*Exporting a =tic_script= for *TIC-80* to use at
compile-time]]. If there is an eval function then the /count of the description/
is checked for non-zero length, and then the eval function is called with the
~tic_mem *memory = (console)->tic~ parameter and a reference to the code
beginning at some offset determined by
~console->desc->src+strlen(console->desc->command)~. This offset calculation is
essentially the command name =eval= length and one for the necessary whitespace
following =eval= and one more to get the actual beginning of the source string
to evaluate.

#+begin_src C
  static void onEvalCommand(Console* console)
  {
    printLine(console);

    const tic_script* script_config = tic_get_script(console->tic);

    if (script_config->eval)
    {
      if(console->desc->count)
        script_config->eval(console->tic,
                            console->desc->src+strlen(console->desc->command));
      else printError(console, "nothing to eval");
    }
    else
    {
      printError(console, "'eval' not implemented for the script");
    }

    commandDone(console);
  }
#+end_src

My evaluation function is entirely free to ignore the TIC-80 memory and simply
evaluate the code provided. ~eval~ is a void function, so I won't know this
succeeded without doing some more work within my own ~eval~ function definition
to print the results of evaluation by R onto the standard error stream (which
I'll do during debugging).

*** Initializing the API
When initializing R as an embedded interpreter, the TIC-80 API also needs to be
initialized. In the Scheme langauge integration for the API, this occurs using a
preprocessor macro which scrubs through the sources and uses a C function to
define multiple Scheme functions within the bounds of the Scheme interpeter.

#+name: a quotation from the *TIC-80* =scheme.c=
#+begin_src c
  static void initAPI(tic_core* core)
  {
  	s7_scheme* sc = core->currentVM;

  #define API_FUNC_DEF(name, desc, helpstr, count, reqcount, ...)					\
  	{scheme_ ## name, desc  "\n" helpstr, count, reqcount, "t80::" #name},

  	static const struct{s7_function func; const char* helpstr; int count; int reqcount; const char* name;} ApiItems[] =
  		{TIC_API_LIST(API_FUNC_DEF)};

  #undef API_FUNC_DEF

  	for (s32 i = 0; i < COUNT_OF(ApiItems); i++) {
  		s7_define_function(sc,
  											 ApiItems[i].name,
  											 ApiItems[i].func,
  											 ApiItems[i].reqcount,
  											 ApiItems[i].count - ApiItems[i].reqcount, // opt count
  											 false, // rest_arg
  											 ApiItems[i].helpstr);
  	}
  }
#+end_src


To aid my own understanding, I'm reorganizing the quoted code in this modified
form. Before doing that I'll read out what I understand. =initAPI= is a void
function which defines a static struct which is identical across calls to this
function (the struct is not recreated each invocation, it would always point to
the same object [a contiguous region of storage]). This static struct is used
with the "scheme core" discussed earlier to define an array of functions
inside the Scheme interpreter.

While it is acceptable to place preprocessor tokens anywhere, and it is
admirable to place the definition immediately prior to its invocation and then
undefine it, it makes more sense to me to define this outside the function body
and not undefine it.

#+name: a modified quotation from the *TIC-80* =scheme.c=
#+begin_src c
  #define API_FUNC_DEF(name, desc, helpstr, count, reqcount, ...) { \
      scheme_##name,                                                \
      desc "\n" helpstr,                                            \
      count,                                                        \
      reqcount,                                                     \
      "t80::"##name                                                 \
    }, /* DONT delete this trailing comma! It's intentional! */

  static void initAPI(tic_core* core)
  {
    s7_scheme* sc = core->currentVM;

    static const struct {
      s7_function func;
      const char* helpstr;
      int count;
      int reqcount;
      const char* name;
    } ApiItems[] = { TIC_API_LIST(API_FUNC_DEF); };

    for (s32 i = 0; i < COUNT_OF(ApiItems); i++) {
      s7_define_function(sc,
                         ApiItems[i].name,
                         ApiItems[i].func,
                         ApiItems[i].reqcount,
                         ApiItems[i].count - ApiItems[i].reqcount, // opt count
                         false, // rest_arg
                         ApiItems[i].helpstr);
    }
  }

R, rather than R code evaluated by R.

Most of these functions can probably be translated from the Scheme language
integration into R, given both use symbolic expressions and CAR and CDR.

#+end_comment

#+name: scheme_trace
#+begin_src C
s7_pointer scheme_trace(s7_scheme* sc, s7_pointer args)
{
    // trace(message color=15)
    tic_core* core = getSchemeCore(sc); tic_mem* tic = (tic_mem*)core;
    const char* msg = s7_string(s7_car(args));
    const int argn = s7_list_length(sc, args);
    const s32 color = argn > 1 ? s7_integer(s7_cadr(args)) : 15;

}
#+end_src

Each API has its own argument types that are accepted by the API functions, with
Python API functions only using ~pkpy_vm *vm~, the Scheme API using ~int32_t
argc~ and ~Janet *argv~, and the Scheme API using ~s7_scheme *sc~ and
~s7_pointer args~; in each case, however, one of these arguments points to a
location in memory which contains a =tic_core= struct, and hence can be used to
access the following ~core->api~, which is the API struct.

What makes it especially confusing /and interesting/ is the following example
from the =scheme.c= file providing the Scheme API integration. Every function
returns an =s7_pointer= which can be used as the ~args~ argument to any other
function. Always, the return value is either ~nil~ (in the LISP sense) or a
pointer of various types (boolean, real, integer), but the function definition
and declaration specify simply ~s7_pointer~. This is similar to ~SEXP~ in R,
where everything is a symbolic expression.

#+name: scheme_fft
#+begin_src C
  s7_pointer scheme_fft(s7_scheme* sc, s7_pointer args)
  {
      // fft(int start_freq, int end_freq=-1) -> float_value
      tic_core* core = getSchemeCore(sc);
      tic_mem* tic = (tic_mem*)core;

      const int argn = s7_list_length(sc, args);
      const s32 start_freq = argn > 0 ? s7_integer(s7_car(args)) : -1;
      const s32 end_freq = argn > 1 ? s7_integer(s7_cadr(args)) : -1;

      return s7_make_real(sc, core->api.fft(tic, start_freq, end_freq));
  }
#+end_src

** The Scheme Core
The function =getSchemeCore= returns a pointer to a =tic_core= object, using an
s7 Scheme pointer to locate a value from a name ~_TIC80~ which the interpreter
is managing. The function converts the name to a Scheme value and returns the
pointer to that object, converted from a Scheme pointer to a void pointer
(assumedly), and automatically type promoted to the return value of ~tic_core
*~.

#+begin_src C
  static const char* TicCore = "_TIC80";

  tic_core* getSchemeCore(s7_scheme* sc)
  {
      return s7_c_pointer(s7_name_to_value(sc, TicCore));
  }
#+end_src

The address of the Scheme value with the name ~_TIC80~ is the address of the
TIC-80 core. The memory of the fantasy computer is located at this address as
well, and ~tic_core->currentVM~ points back to this start of memory as well (I
think). This creates a sort of ring of memory.

** The TIC Core and TIC memory
#+begin_src C :noweb-ref struct tic_mem
  struct tic_mem
  {
      tic80           product;
      tic_ram*        ram;
      tic_cartridge   cart;

      tic_ram*        base_ram;

      char saveid[TIC_SAVEID_SIZE];

  	<<union struct tic_mem.input>>
  };
#+end_src

The field ~product~ has type =tic80=, whose defintion is quoted here.

#+begin_src C
  typedef struct
  {
    struct
    {
      void (*trace)(const char* text, u8 color);
      void (*error)(const char* info);
      void (*exit)();
    } callback;

    struct
    {
      TIC80_SAMPLETYPE* buffer;
      s32 count;
    } samples;

    u32 *screen;
  } tic80;

it's not really necessary. Having a single point where all blocks is referenced
is okay, or this block ("define C symbols to be callable from R") could be

** Procedures to initialize, close, and re-initialize R
Both =initScheme= and =closeScheme= begin with casting ~tic_mem *tic~ to a
~tic_core *~, effectively mapping from one area of memory to another (like a
hashmap or simply shifting the memory until the child struct is aligned with the
parent struct).
# Adjust the prior sentence because it's inaccurate.
This map permits access within =closeScheme= to the =currentVM= member of the
TIC-80 core memory. This is only my basic understanding, and some of it is
adventurous bullshitting; I really don't know if that was true, what I said, and
I don't much care if it wasn't because I'm writing this as I still work to
understand what I'm reading, so this is only a draft paragraph.

In the Lua integration the manner to initialize Lua is the use of a pointer to a
=lua_State= type (which is actually a thread, but indirectly refers to the state
associated with the thread). Every Lua C API function requires a pointer of this
type as its first argument, so calling the procedure ~lua_newstate~ creates a
fresh, independent thread of execution. That's all that is required to embed and
then instantiate a Lua 5.4 interpreter within a larger application.

The general design of TIC-80 relies on an embedded language API using pointers
to the interpreter as the first argument of many of its functions. This is an
active design choice and is likely related to memory management in TIC-80, which
is necessarily complicated by the fact that langauge interpreters are of
different sizes, as are their language codes which say ~Hello, world!~. It's a
complicated topic. I won't think on it.

R is not designed to be embedded in the same sense as other languages, it is not
an extension language for other programs, it is /the main program/ and even has
built-in variables implying it is assumed to be true that
=R_running_as_main_program=, even when embedded, and a potential ~longjmp~
complicates matters more. Still, we will push on towards our goal despite my
ignorance and inexperience.

R expects the arguments from the operating system shell to be passed along to
it---"Yes, even when embedded."---and thus we need fake arguments. For now,
we'll borrow the code from the /Writing R Extensions/ manual to pass
~Rf_initEmbeddedR~ some fake arguments, and we'll write a procedure to handle
restarting R as necessary and tracking the current interpreter (there can be
only one).

** Cartidge callback commands
It might not be advisable to define the ~TIC~ function in the R API as
~`TIC-80`~, but because R allows non-syntactic names I'll use it so that the
actual name of the machine can be used. If the machine were called ~MANE~ we'd
want to use that, but if we were forced to use ~main~ that'd be a nice homophone
at least. The =exists= function doesn't use symbols, it uses strings to lookup
symbols so that is why that part differs in the chunk below.

#+begin_src C :noweb-ref cartridge commands
  static void callRFn_TIC80(tic_mem* tic) {
  #if !defined R_INTERNALS_H_
  #error "R_GlobalEnv not defined because Rinternals.h not properly included... somehow."
  #endif
  	/* if (exists("TIC-80") && is.function(`TIC-80`)) `TIC-80`() */
  	Rf_eval(Rf_mkString("if (exists(\"TIC-80\") && is.function(`TIC-80`)) "\
  											"`TIC-80`()"),
  					R_GlobalEnv);
  }
#+end_src

Previously, the following macro only generated R code defining syntactic
identifiers; after reviewing the help page for quoting in R, it makes more sense
for it to always quote the name to be called as a function if that name exists
and is a function (the latter test also using back-quoting, but no matter). This
allows the calling of both syntactic and non-syntactic names in R, allowing the
macro to generate the C code which will call any defined R function in the
global environment. An obvious extension would be the definition of another
macro expanding to a call of this one with supplied, alternative environment. An
inobvious (to me, at first) issue is that anything which is a non-syntactic name
in R is absolutely a non-syntactic name in C and cannot be used! The ability to
define a C function to call an R function with any name does not help me in the
way I originally intended, unless I rewrite the macro to use another argument
(if supplied) as the R function name that will be called in R, while the
argument =f= is the C function identifier. That's too much work for now and zero
benefit, so I continue using the previous code block to define the C function to
call a non-syntactic name in R as a function.

below, =it3= will be a pointer to an array of tic_scripts, which is iterated

specifier is ~const~, so what's going on with the syntax that I don't remember?
Does it only apply to the first declared variable in the identifier list?

***** Syntax highlighting the reserved words in R
Syntax highlighting is not always easy, especially when regular expressions are
involved. What we are using in TIC-80 is a more naive approach, but one which is
easier to maintain because it is less powerful and less flexible. It is at the
opposite side of the spectrum from a full parser or a language server.

The simple system in TIC-80 merely highlights all keywords of a language in one
colour, and all other syntax elements in another colour (presumably, the default
foreground colour).

R has only a few reserved words, and very little of it is "critical syntax"
characters. The seemingly fundamental syntax characters ~{~ and ~(~ are actually
function calls, which could be shadowed if desired.

Reserved words cannot be used as syntactic names, but as non-syntactic names
they can be used, so ~`if`~ is a different symbol or name than ~if~ and may be
used otherwise, as with ~`function`~.

#+name: Specify the reserved words for automatic syntax
#+begin_src c
	static const char* const RKeywords [] =
	{
		"if", "else", "repeat", "while", "function", "for", "in", "next", "break",

		"NA_complex_", "NA_character_",
		/* et cetera, see ?dots */
		"...", "..1", "..2", "..3", "..4", "..5", "..6", "..7", "..8", "..9",
	};
#+end_src

****** =..n=: variadic argument access across the natural numbers
The entirety of the natural numbers are reserved words when the occur after the
characters ~..~, becuase any ordinal number is usable to access a member of the
dotted argument (how R cleverly deals with variadic arguments). The functions
which otherwise handle these variadic argument list members are not reserved
words, for example ~..length()~ or even ~..n()~ are not reserved.

***** R API implementation keywords
The API keywords are either callbacks to the TIC-80 virtual machine---which can
be thought of as an operating system interface---or the user-facing API
functions. The following definitions are simply taken from the file =scheme.c=,
which implements the s7 Scheme integration, and the obvious changes made (Scheme
changed to R).

While [[https://github.com/nesbox/TIC-80/discussions/2100][in this GitHub discussion]] nesbox claims that one can simply place your
source files, with their respective langauge file suffixes, in "demos/" and the
build process will take care of generating a .tic.dat file, that doesn't appear
to be true [[https://github.com/nesbox/TIC-80/commit/87e91e7dd903dac7a9c232d1127a32b0d4a8dc54][given this commit]] and the inability for me to build solely due to
these files not being created automatically by a CMake build target. That's an
issue that will need to be opened.

After taking the time to understand the macros used in the definition of
RAPIKeywords, borrowed from SchemeAPIKeywords, I would /not/ bother to do it any
other way, as in the way Python or Janet did it. It is really, really neat. I
like this.

  };

** TODO The default cartridge
The demonstration (default) cartridge or ROM is a bunch of byte code included
from a =dat= file. The bytes are read directly into a =u8= array ~DemoRom[]~.
The =dat= file is created during build from =demos/rdemo.r=. Basing the file off
of the other demo files, I have written the usual TIC-80 "Hello, world!" in a
function style in R, and the contents of the metadata are identical to the Ruby
or Scheme demos (as every demo cartridge uses the same demo content by
convention).

**** TODO Planned work
- S7 :: the new R OOP package
- S6 :: the old new R OOP package
- S4 :: formal OOP package for R
- S3 :: ye olde informal OOP package: what I'm already using in the bunny benchmark

The next steps in completing the Bunny benchmark are to decide on a functional
approach or an object-oriented approach. Integrating the new S7 package would be
interesting.

** DONE Modifying =CMakeLists.txt= and writing CMake build generation files
CLOSED: [2024-10-12 Sat 01:50]
CMake is used as the Make build file generator for TIC-80. I need to integrate
the R langauge embedding into TIC-80's build process using CMake now.

**** Tasks to complete related to this heading:
- [X] Patch =CMakeLists.txt=, if necessary.
- [X] Write a CMake file for R, specifically.
- [X] Test the build succeeds: build fails with the message "R.h not found."
- [X] Test ~eval~ on the TIC-80 command-line.

**** Patching =CMakeLists.txt=
Is it necessary to patch =CMakeLists.txt=? Yes, but only to include the line
~include(cmake/r.cmake)~.

**** Writing =cmake/r.cmake=
Based off of the Scheme and Python CMake files, I wrote the following. I doubt R
will ever run on N3DS, regardless of whatever hacky homebrew environment is
available. R is simply too complex of an interpreter with too complex of a build
chain (is there Fortran?) to ever work there. Baremetal? I won't bother.

=renv.cmake= is used at build time to set the environment variables R requires

source of truth", and to populate the values in a header file created at build
time (following the instructions in [[https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/guide/tutorial/A%20Basic%20Starting%20Point.html#exercise-3-adding-a-version-number-and-configured-header-file][/Adding a Version Number and Configured

** Failed symbol registration                                       :ARCHIVE:
This is not symbolic programming, but I wish it were! Oh, R, oh, LISP, how I
miss both of these. I can't wait to finish learning enough of C to say I can
manage my way through a complex project so that I can readily forget much of it
until I need it again. Woe unto future me, should I need it again!

**** A failed approach to registering functions with R
A naive approach, or a "clever" approach I tried to take, is to define all of
the C functions that R can call using functions defined through a C macro and
calling them using the ~.C~ interface, however there is a much better system
built-in to R which I will use instead.

The following use of preprocessor directives is inappropriate, as the literal
macro argument will be substituted, not evaluated at run-time.

#+name: iterate over the R API keywords, defining each R function (erroneous)
#+begin_src C
  #define defineRFn_(keyword) Rf_eval(Rf_mkString("t80."#keyword" <- function(...) .C(r_"#keyword", ...);"), R_GlobalEnv);
  #define doDefineRFunction(keyword) defineRFn_(keyword)
  	for (int kiwi = 0; kiwi <= config->api_keywordsCount; kiwi++) {
  		doDefineRFunction(config->api_keywords[kiwi]);
  	}
  #undef doDefineRFunction
  #undef defineRFn_
#+end_src

This won't work because neither parameterized macro will evaluate the given
expressions. Using C string functions and a character buffer would allow me to
construct the R expressions dynamically, but there's no need to take this
correct, but naive, approach. Use the functionality built-in to R's C API!

#+name: iterate over the R API keywords, defining each R function
#+begin_src C
  tic_script *config = (tic_get_script(tic));
  char command_string[100];
  for (int kw = 0; kw <= config->api_keywordsCount; kw++) {
  	memset(command_string, '\0', sizeof('\0'));
  	
  #define cmdstr(f, ...) f(command_string, __VA_ARGS__)
  	cmdstr(strcpy, "t80.");
  	cmdstr(strcat, config->api_keywords[kw]);
  	cmdstr(strcat, " <- \(...) .C(r_");
  	cmdstr(strcat, config->api_keywords[kw]);
  	cmdstr(strcat, ", ...);");
  #undef cmdstr

  	Rf_eval(Rf_mkString(command_string), R_GlobalEnv);
  }

** DONE Registering symbols in R from C
CLOSED: [2024-10-19 Sat 22:01]
"Symbols need to be registered with R from C to be used in R," is what I wrote
to introduce this paragraph in its first draft; I'm not sure if registering
symbols is actually required, or what the purpose is. It might not be fully
relevant to my use of R. My appreciation of this topic, at the moment, is that
it is used to define new primites so that functions in R are automatically
defined to call registered C functions.

/Writing R Extensions/ documents how to register native routines with the
embedded R interpreter for later use from within R code. The objects =info=,
=cMethods=, and =callMethods= are desribed in turn in §8.1.3 of the documentation.
Only =cMethods= needs to be defined for the purposes of using R as a scripting
langauge for TIC-80 games.

#+name: example of registering native symbols
#+begin_src c
  DllInfo *info = R_getEmbeddingDllInfo();
  R_registerRoutines(info, cMethods, callMethods, NULL, NULL);
#+end_src

Native routines (symbols) registered with R get called through "the =.C=
interface," which is how R interacts with native routines when it is in control
of the main event loop. When embedded, and especially when not in control of the
main event loop, R needs to be told about native routines in a slightly
different manner, because R is not in control of loading shared libraries, /it
is the shared library/!

The symbols are the functions which enable scripting and wrap underlying C
routines that every scripting language API in TIC-80 hooks into. These symbols
are automatically made available to R when it is embedded in the application.
The function which performs the registration is built-in to R, and [[register symbols with R example][exampled in
the following block]] (it is documented in §8.1.3 in /Writing R Extensions/).

** Meshing the event loops of TIC-80 and R
There is a section in the /R Extensions/ manual which focuses on meshing the
event loops of R and the alternative front-end. There are two event loops in R
which need special attention.

*** ensure the front-end is not frozen out during the event loop waiting for responses from sockets


* Creating build assets at build-time from source files
The is a build/assets directory in the TIC-80 sources containing DAT formatted
files which are needed to include benchmarks for various scripting language
integrations and also the demo and default cartridges for these langauges. The
Git repository for TIC-80 currently contains pre-built assets, and the upstream
GitHub hosted interface to that repository has workflows which will build these
assets at build time using a Windows BATCH script. That limited my ability to
develop for TIC-80, so after successfully compiling the build tools (prj2cart
and bin2txt) on Linux I wrote a BASH script to call these for all of the build
asset source files.

** DONE Convert assets to DAT formats (on UNIX-likes)
CLOSED: [2024-10-25 Fri 16:11]
This script can be used to convert build assets (particularly =rmark.r= and
=rdemo.r=) to the DAT format used by TIC-80 at runtime. It requires using the
the original, unedited versions of proj2cart and bin2txt. It will only work on
UNIX-likes, so a portable interface that will work on any development machine
motivated the edits in the next sextion.

** DONE Bug-fixing the creation of new R-based cartridges
CLOSED: [2024-10-17 Thu 19:19]
*** DONE Are the demo and benchmark cartridges created correctly?
CLOSED: [2024-10-17 Thu 19:17]
What I found was that with only building for R that I can't create a new Scheme
cartridge, but with the same effect that a Lua cartridge is created. R has been
included in the build, so because the cartridge is the same as the Lua cartridge
I'm going to do a check and make sure that I haven't made a file copying error
(blindly copying the Lua demo, which I know I did at one point before I
successfully built the DAT files myself).

I'm now confident that the DAT files are derived from my R-based source files,
and not Lua-based source files. The next step is to test if that was a
sufficient fix, indicating the problem was a file copying error (from a
different test build), or another issue.

After testing I am certain that it was not a user error caused by copying a
Lua-based file. The =new= command is not creating an R cartridge---using the
demo or default cartridge---correctly, so I need to work out why that is with a
more involved search of the sources and then some debugging.

*** A new cart can be created with "new r", but when going to the editor the R demo cartridge is not used (the Lua cartridge is used).

*** DONE Is the =.id=, =.name=, or =.fileExtension= field to blame?
CLOSED: [2024-10-17 Thu 19:17]
Looking at the Scheme language integration it seems my mistake may be calling
the command with a lower-case ~r~, when I should call it with an upper-case ~R~,
if and only if the ~.name~ member of the ~const tic_script~ object in my
language integration has that casing.

#+begin_example C
  TIC_EXPORT const tic_script EXPORT_SCRIPT(R) =
  {
  	/* The first five members of the struct have the sum total following
  	 ,* size. */
  	/* sizeof(u8) + 3 * sizeof(char *)  */
  	.id                     = 42,
  	.name                   = "r",
  	.fileExtension          = ".r",
  	.projectComment         = "##"
#+end_example

Unfortunatley, as shown by the quotation, that is not the case.

Perhaps it is the arbitrary ~.id~ I chose. How are the other IDs determined? I
looked at the IDs of every other type of TIC-80 scripting language and noted
these before sorting them. I now know what ID to give R; this should be
documented in the TIC-80 Wiki.

- lua :: 10
- ruby :: 11
- js :: 12
- moonscript :: 13
- fennel :: 14
- squirrel :: 15
- wren :: 16
- wasm :: 17
- janet :: 18
- scheme :: 19
- python :: 20
- r :: 21

I thought that my R integration might have an issue because of the name, but
like Moonscript the name is prefixed with a period in the file extension, so
that wasn't a problem. I don't know why I thought that might have been an issue,
but I'm only noting my thinking process here.

It looks like R is the eleventh language added to TIC-80. There is room for five
more languages, given I saw a "maximum number of langauges" elsewhere in the
codebase set to sixteen.

*** DONE Is =tic_add_script= rejecting the script?
CLOSED: [2024-10-17 Thu 19:16]
This procedure is used at runtime to add scripts to the ~Scripts~ array. The
macro is expanded to something much more complex, which serves to actually look
at potential script shared objects.

#+begin_src C
  void tic_add_script(const tic_script* script)
  {
      s32 index = 0;
      FOREACH_LANG(it)
      {
          if(it->id == script->id || strcmp(it->name, script->name) == 0)
          {
              // script already exists
              return;
          }

          index++;
      }

      if(index < MAX_SUPPORTED_LANGS)
      {
          Scripts[index] = script;
          qsort(Scripts, index + 1, sizeof Scripts[0], compareScripts);
      }
  }
#+end_src

- How is the ~Scripts~ array used?
- [X] How is ~it~ defined at runtime? ~it~ likely means "iterator", the current one.

It doesn't appear that ~it~ is defined in /any way/. It is a literal macro
argument used in concatenation of an identifier, and no more.

~Scripts~ is only used within =script.c=; it is only used within the functions
~tic_add_script~, ~tic_get_script~, and ~tic_scripts~. Collectively, =script.c=
defines functionality for compile-time and run-time population of the =Scripts=
array, which is used for autocompletion of certain command-line commands within
the TIC-80 console (~new~ in particular).

~tic_get_script~ checks if the argument ~memory~ (of type =tic_mem *=) has the
same id as any of the =tic_scripts= in =Scripts=. If none of the scripts match,
either an uninitialized =tic_script= called ~empty~ is returned or the address
of the whole array is returned (effectively returning the first member of the
array). ~tic_scripts~ returns the address of the whole array forthright.

** DONE Compilation error due to ambiguous type and storage class
CLOSED: [2024-10-17 Thu 19:20]
When compiling the API definitions in =r.c=, I experienced an issue with the
type and storage class definition of the function ~Rf_mainloop~. The compiler
doesn't know how what type or storage class to assign to the function because it
was meant as a function call outside of any other functions, which is illegal
and illogical in C, so it was merely an identifier that the C compiler didn't
know how to handle.

A reproducible example would cover other types of constant objects as well, like
numbers and strings.

#+begin_src C
  #include <stdio.h>

  0;
  'a';
  "A";
  printf();

  int main(void) { return 0 };
#+end_src

This will produce, similarly, the errors observed in the following journal-like entry.

When a function call or any expression occurs /outside of a function definition
called from a call chain beginning within main/, an error will occur due to
conflicting types deriving from the compiler trying to resolve an expression of
some type as a declaration. That is, only delcarations of data types may occur
outside of function bodies, and only the main function can begin a chain of
function calls. A function call is illegal outside of these chains; expressions
of any kind other than declarations are illegal outside of these chains.
