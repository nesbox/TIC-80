The homepage of the R langauge is https://www.r-project.org/.

Any section marked TODO indicates that the section must be edited for clarity,
or is a draft which must be completed, before publishing this literate program
to share it.

* DONE Sectioning of the =r.c= source file
CLOSED: [2024-11-06 Wed 00:33]
How a literate program is sectioned is an important consideration. Normally a
literate program should be written from an expert point of view on the
implementation details. Literate programming is not a great paradigm for
exploration, because it is easy to become mired in the details and not move
forward: explaining and implementing. This section of the literate program
tangles together all the source blocks composing the actual C source file
defining the *TIC-80* fantasy computer *R* langauge support for writing demos,
programs, and games.

Much of the *R* langauge and its implementation was inspired by a C++
implementation of Scheme (if I recall things I've read, so it's hearsay but go
ahead and research it yourself), so aspects of the Scheme *TIC-80* langauge
integration will be honoured and "Scheme" will appear in several places, though
none of it is Scheme any more.  Before a final public release this will be
changed so that no references to "Scheme" occur in the code.

** Requirements
The requirements of the integration of R in TIC-80 are briefly noted.

- TIC-80 event loop is respected and not interfered with (graphical application
  is performance-sensitive).
- Initialize multiple R interpreters during the lifetime of the embedding
  application, but not simultaneously. One interpreter should be initialized
  after closing another.
- Statically built R library; no expectation of system libraries available, like
  a Fortran installation, or various headers that would be installed with Rtools
  or something on Windows.
- Memory for storage of objects limited to 126 KB; I don't think the available
  memory is limited otherwise, but R will be limited to storing 128 KB of
  objects in memory. No real expectation of disk storage or filesystem.

** The TIC-80 System
*** The C API
Every scripting langauge binding to the C API provides a method of writing
programs in scripting languages which call the C functions which /really
underly/ the game engine of the fantasy console.

Eventually, every C function defining the langauge bindings to the C
API of TIC-80---wrapping the underlying C functions of the game engine
in interpreted (or WASM-compiled) scripting languages---will call a C
function with predictable arguments to have TIC-80 finally act upon
something. As an example, see the trace function in the R
integration. The Scheme integration is just like it.  Some data types
of the scripting language's C API are created,
and---potentially---something is evaluated, then the results are
passed to the TIC-80 C API.

#+begin_comment
The following block has "yes" as the argument for noweb so that when exported
the following will quote the C source for the trace function wrapper without me
needing to copy it and update it when changes are made.

  		u8 color = TIC_DEFAULT_COLOR;

  		}

** TODO Introduction
*** Initialization of the interpreter within an embedding application
The R interpreter, like the [[https://ccrma.stanford.edu/software/snd/snd/s7.html][s7 Scheme interpreter]], needs to be initialized or
re-initialized if it isn't running when TIC-80 wants to request something (the
game source code, or a debugger entry point or a callback or something else) be
evaluated, so the program either "initialize[s] R, returning if that fails"
or reinitializes R in that subroutine.

~evalR~ is one of the doorways through which TIC-80 C routines and functions
enter into communion with R /as an embedded script interpreter/ within TIC-80.

#+begin_src C :noweb-ref cartridge commands
  void evalR(tic_mem *memory, const char *code) {
  	setEnvironmentVariablesIfUnset();
  	if (!R_initialized_once) {
  		initR(memory, code);
  		R_initialized_once = true;
  	}

  	if (R_initialized_once) {
      SEXP RESULT = R_ParseEvalString(code, R_GlobalEnv);
    }
  }
#+end_src

Before ~R_GlobalEnv~ is available, the C symbol must be initialized by calling
~InitBaseEnv()~ and then calling ~InitGlobalEnv~, both of which are defined in
=main/envir.c= in the R sources. The declaration of ~R_GlobalEnv~ is in
=include/Rinternals.h=; ~R_GlobalEnv~ is defined as a ~SEXP~ with the modifier
~LibExtern~ (~LibExtern SEXP R_GlobalEnv;~). These functions are called in
~setup_Rmainloop~, and are called in a specific order along with many other
functions which initialize R and its behaviours and capabilities (including
arithmetic); it is very important that ~setup_Rmainloop~ is called. This
function is called automatically by calling ~Rf_mainloop~.

*** Initializing Scheme
The initScheme function takes a pointer to the *TIC-80* memory and a character
pointer to the code that Scheme should evaluate (when it's initialized). To
promote a clean room, Scheme is terminated before it is initialized through
calling the =s7_init= function coming directly from the *s7* library
and before the API is initialized; this should remove a host of errors related
to the lifetime of objects, data, and values in the object table that is managed
by the interpreter, and every time the user of *TIC-80* runs their game a fresh
interpreter is spawned to avoid the garbage that could otherwise pollute their
shiny new bug-fixes (which would introduce new bugs!). An error handling
function is defined and then a special bit of Scheme code is evaluated before
another bit is evaluated, a variable defined, and then finally the game code
loaded. A final task is to check if the function =TIC= is defined in the
Scheme LISP image by that time, and if it is then that is the "entry point"
where the interpreter is given freedom to evaluate to its hearts content and
make callbacks to the *TIC-80* fantasy computer through the API.

#+name: quotation

  	/* See "set the error-hook function.scm" and pretend its a properly escaped C string. */
  	s7_eval_c_string(sc, <<set the error-hook function.scm>>);

  	const bool isTicDefined = s7_is_defined(sc, ticFnName);
  	if (!isTicDefined) {
  		if (core->data) {
  			core->data->error(core->data->data, "TIC function is not defined");
  		}
  	}

  	return true;
  }
#+end_src

#+name: set the error-hook function
#+begin_src scheme
  (set! (hook-functions *error-hook*)
        (list (lambda (hook)
                (__TIC_ErrorHandler
                 (format #f "~s: ~a\n--STACKTRACE--\n~a"
                         ((owlet) 'error-type)
                         (apply format #f (hook 'data))
                         (stacktrace)))
                (set! (hook 'result) #f))))
#+end_src

Based on the requirements of *TIC-80* it seems clear that I need to define a
wrapping function to initialize *R* and pass around some information
appropriately.

*** Console evaluation
The console of the main application, when running, has an =eval= command which
can be used to evaluate source code in the scripting language of the currently
loaded cartridge. This is a good target for integrating R into TIC-80. I need to
be able to evaluate R in any context, so to be able to evaluate R in the context
of a CLI is natural to both R and TIC-80; this is where I'll start.

#+begin_comment
What is a context?
#+end_comment

The ~onEvalCommand~ function in the TIC-80 C API takes a =Console *= which is
used to retrieve access to the console. This console object is used by functions
for making the VTTY carriage return (begin a new line), retrieving the
=tic_script= object which contains pointers to the evaluation function, etc.

As a test of R working, I will print the values of ~R.version.string~ and
~R.version~ on the console, first by simply retrieving these values from R and
printing them using the C API, and then eventually printing them using the
TIC-80 API function ~trace~.

~script_config->eval~ here is the same ~void (*eval)(tic_mem* tic, const char*
code)~ defined later in [[*Exporting a =tic_script= for *TIC-80* to use at
compile-time]]. If there is an eval function then the /count of the description/
is checked for non-zero length, and then the eval function is called with the
~tic_mem *memory = (console)->tic~ parameter and a reference to the code
beginning at some offset determined by
~console->desc->src+strlen(console->desc->command)~. This offset calculation is
essentially the command name =eval= length and one for the necessary whitespace
following =eval= and one more to get the actual beginning of the source string
to evaluate.

#+begin_src C
  static void onEvalCommand(Console* console)
  {
    printLine(console);

    const tic_script* script_config = tic_get_script(console->tic);

    if (script_config->eval)
    {
      if(console->desc->count)
        script_config->eval(console->tic,
                            console->desc->src+strlen(console->desc->command));
      else printError(console, "nothing to eval");
    }
    else
    {
      printError(console, "'eval' not implemented for the script");
    }

    commandDone(console);
  }
#+end_src

My evaluation function is entirely free to ignore the TIC-80 memory and simply
evaluate the code provided. ~eval~ is a void function, so I won't know this
succeeded without doing some more work within my own ~eval~ function definition
to print the results of evaluation by R onto the standard error stream (which
I'll do during debugging).

*** Initializing the API
When initializing R as an embedded interpreter, the TIC-80 API also needs to be
initialized. In the Scheme langauge integration for the API, this occurs using a
preprocessor macro which scrubs through the sources and uses a C function to
define multiple Scheme functions within the bounds of the Scheme interpeter.

#+name: a quotation from the *TIC-80* =scheme.c=
#+begin_src c
  static void initAPI(tic_core* core)
  {
    s7_scheme* sc = core->currentVM;

  #define API_FUNC_DEF(name, desc, helpstr, count, reqcount, ...)         \
    {scheme_ ## name, desc  "\n" helpstr, count, reqcount, "t80::" #name},

    static const struct{s7_function func; const char* helpstr; int count; int reqcount; const char* name;} ApiItems[] =
      {TIC_API_LIST(API_FUNC_DEF)};

  #undef API_FUNC_DEF

    for (s32 i = 0; i < COUNT_OF(ApiItems); i++) {
      s7_define_function(sc,
                         ApiItems[i].name,
                         ApiItems[i].func,
                         ApiItems[i].reqcount,
                         ApiItems[i].count - ApiItems[i].reqcount, // opt count
                         false, // rest_arg
                         ApiItems[i].helpstr);
    }
  }
#+end_src


To aid my own understanding, I'm reorganizing the quoted code in this modified
form. Before doing that I'll read out what I understand. =initAPI= is a void
function which defines a static struct which is identical across calls to this
function (the struct is not recreated each invocation, it would always point to
the same object [a contiguous region of storage]). This static struct is used
with the "scheme core" discussed earlier to define an array of functions
inside the Scheme interpreter.

While it is acceptable to place preprocessor tokens anywhere, and it is
admirable to place the definition immediately prior to its invocation and then
undefine it, it makes more sense to me to define this outside the function body
and not undefine it.

#+name: a modified quotation from the *TIC-80* =scheme.c=
#+begin_src c
  #define API_FUNC_DEF(name, desc, helpstr, count, reqcount, ...) { \
      scheme_##name,                                                \
      desc "\n" helpstr,                                            \
      count,                                                        \
      reqcount,                                                     \
      "t80::"##name                                                 \
    }, /* DONT delete this trailing comma! It's intentional! */

  static void initAPI(tic_core* core)
  {
    s7_scheme* sc = core->currentVM;

    static const struct {
      s7_function func;
      const char* helpstr;
      int count;
      int reqcount;
      const char* name;
    } ApiItems[] = { TIC_API_LIST(API_FUNC_DEF); };

    for (s32 i = 0; i < COUNT_OF(ApiItems); i++) {
      s7_define_function(sc,
                         ApiItems[i].name,
                         ApiItems[i].func,
                         ApiItems[i].reqcount,
                         ApiItems[i].count - ApiItems[i].reqcount, // opt count
                         false, // rest_arg
                         ApiItems[i].helpstr);

* TODO Writing the R API for TIC-80
The TIC-80 API functions need to be defined in the global environment after
initializing R, and if they're writtin in C then they need to be registered with
R, rather than R code evaluated by R.

** Macros and PREDECLARATIONS
Every function wrapping an internal TIC-80 C API must eventually call an
internal API function, as in the following example. These functions each
require, as their first argument, ~tic_mem *tic~.

#+begin_example C
  core->api.print(tic, text, x, y, color, fixed, scale, alt)
#+end_example

That is made easier by defining the following symbols and macros to reference
them.

#+begin_src C :noweb-ref PREDECLARATIONS
  static tic_mem *RTicRam;
  #define TICAPI(CMD, ...) ((tic_core *)RTicRam)->api.CMD(RTicRam __VA_OPT__(,) __VA_ARGS__)
#+end_src

The example then becomes as follows.

#+begin_example C
  RTICAPI.print(RTICRAM, text, x, y, color, fixed, scale, alt);
#+end_example

Some helpful macros are defined for accessing arguments safely.

#+begin_src C :noweb-ref PREDECLARATIONS
  #define ARGS(x) Rf_elt(args, x)
  #define ARGN(n) (Rf_length(args) >= n && !Rf_isNull(ARGS(n)))
#+end_src

Functions in the R TIC-80 API subject to manual reference counting require more
attention in C programming may make use of the following macros. These macros
are /only useful for C constants/, as everything within =args= is already
protected from garbage collection because =...= is in use already in the
=.External= interface. However, any /wholly new SEXPs/ created from values
extracted from =args= will need to be protected. References to existing SEXPs
will not require further protection.

#+begin_src C :noweb-ref PREDECLARATIONS
  #define RSTRT(x) SEXP x(SEXP args) { int protected_count = 0; const int argn = Rf_length(args);
  #define RUNP UNPROTECT(protected_count);
  #define REND }
  #define ProtectAndIncrement(x) (++protected_count, PROTECT(x))
  #define psint(x) ProtectAndIncrement(Rf_ScalarInteger(x))
  #define pslgl(x) ProtectAndIncrement(Rf_ScalarLogical(x))
  #define psstr(x) ProtectAndIncrement(Rf_ScalarString(x))
#+end_src

This macro makes it easier to evaluate R code in the global environment.

#+begin_src C :noweb-ref PREDECLARATIONS
  #define EVALG(x) R_ParseEvalString(x, R_GlobalEnv)
#+end_src

** Procedures to initialize, close, and re-initialize R
In the Lua integration the manner to initialize Lua is the use of a pointer to a
=lua_State= type (which is actually a thread, but indirectly refers to the state
associated with the thread). Every Lua C API function requires a pointer of this
type as its first argument, so calling the procedure ~lua_newstate~ creates a
fresh, independent thread of execution. That's all that is required to embed and
then instantiate a Lua 5.4 interpreter within a larger application.

R does not require passing a pointer to a virtual machine to use it. If the
interpreter is embedded within an application all of the functionality of the R
interpreter is made readily available without reference to some virtual machine.
~Rf_initEmbeddedR~ pairs with ~Rf_endEmbeddedR(0);~. R is not designed to have
multiple virtual machines running in parallel within the same embedding context,
likely, so that is why it protects itself from being initialized more than once.
R does its own virtual machine management.

The general design of TIC-80 relies on an embedded language API using pointers
to the interpreter as the first argument of many of its functions. This is an
active design choice and is likely related to memory management in TIC-80, which
is necessarily complicated by the fact that langauge interpreters are of
different sizes, as are their language codes which say ~Hello, world!~. It's a
complicated topic. I won't think on it.

R is not designed to be embedded in the same sense as other languages, it is not
an extension language for other programs, it is /the main program/ and even has
built-in variables implying it is assumed to be true that
=R_running_as_main_program=, even when embedded, and a potential ~longjmp~
complicates matters more. Still, we will push on towards our goal despite my
ignorance and inexperience.

R expects the arguments from the operating system shell to be passed along to
it---"Yes, even when embedded."---and thus we need fake arguments. For now,
we'll borrow the code from the /Writing R Extensions/ manual to pass
~Rf_initEmbeddedR~ some fake arguments, and we'll write a procedure to handle
restarting R as necessary and tracking the current interpreter (there can be
only one).

** Callbacks for BOOT, MENU, BDR, and SCN
Previously, the following macro only generated R code defining syntactic
identifiers; after reviewing the help page for quoting in R, it makes more sense
for it to always quote the name to be called as a function if that name exists
and is a function (the latter test also using back-quoting, but no matter). This
allows the calling of both syntactic and non-syntactic names in R, allowing the
macro to generate the C code which will call any defined R function in the
global environment. An obvious extension would be the definition of another
macro expanding to a call of this one with supplied, alternative environment. An
inobvious (to me, at first) issue is that anything which is a non-syntactic name
in R is absolutely a non-syntactic name in C and cannot be used! The ability to
define a C function to call an R function with any name does not help me in the
way I originally intended, unless I rewrite the macro to use another argument
(if supplied) as the R function name that will be called in R, while the
argument =f= is the C function identifier. That's too much work for now and zero
benefit, so I continue using the previous code block to define the C function to
call a non-syntactic name in R as a function.

The callback functions below are okay. If you're reading this, coming from the
current mess in the [[Debugging segfaults]] section then references to R_GlobalEnv
in this code block aren't related to the references to that environment in the

was invoked its argument would expand to =it3=. When used in the first define
below, =it3= will be a pointer to an array of tic_scripts, which is iterated
over (explaning the =it= argument). ~*script~ is modified, but the type
specifier is ~const~, so what's going on with the syntax that I don't remember?
Does it only apply to the first declared variable in the identifier list?

*** Providing lists of syntax elements for highlighting and outline generation

#+end_src

**** Syntax highlighting the reserved words in R
Syntax highlighting is not always easy, especially when regular expressions are
involved. What we are using in TIC-80 is a more naive approach, but one which is
easier to maintain because it is less powerful and less flexible. It is at the
opposite side of the spectrum from a full parser or a language server.

The simple system in TIC-80 merely highlights all keywords of a language in one
colour, and all other syntax elements in another colour (presumably, the default
foreground colour).

R has only a few reserved words, and very little of it is "critical syntax"
characters. The seemingly fundamental syntax characters ~{~ and ~(~ are actually
function calls, which could be shadowed if desired.

Reserved words cannot be used as syntactic names, but as non-syntactic names
they can be used, so ~`if`~ is a different symbol or name than ~if~ and may be
used otherwise, as with ~`function`~.

#+name: Specify the reserved words for automatic syntax
#+begin_src c
  static const char* const RKeywords [] =
  {
  	"if", "else", "repeat", "while", "function", "for", "in", "next", "break",
  	"TRUE", "FALSE", "NULL", "Inf", "NaN", "NA", "NA_integer_", "NA_real_",
  	"NA_complex_", "NA_character_",
  	/* et cetera, see ?dots */
  	"...", "..1", "..2", "..3", "..4", "..5", "..6", "..7", "..8", "..9",
  };
#+end_src

***** =..n=: variadic argument access across the natural numbers
The entirety of the natural numbers are reserved words when the occur after the
characters ~..~, becuase any ordinal number is usable to access a member of the
dotted argument (how R cleverly deals with variadic arguments). The functions
which otherwise handle these variadic argument list members are not reserved
words, for example ~..length()~ or even ~..n()~ are not reserved.

**** Outline generation
Generating and outline will provide the editor with the ability to jump to
different areas of the script being written.

      || (c == '_') || (c == '.')
      );
  }

      ptr = strstr(ptr, FuncString);

      if(ptr)
      {
        ptr += sizeof FuncString - 1;

        const char* start = ptr;
        const char* end = start;

        while(*ptr)
        {
          char c = *ptr;

          if(r_isalnum(c));
          else
          {
            end = ptr;
            break;
          }
          ptr++;
        }

        if(end > start)
        {
          items = realloc(items, (*size + 1) * Size);

          items[*size].pos = start;
          items[*size].size = (s32)(end - start);

          (*size)++;
        }
      }
      else break;
    }

    return items;
  }
#+end_src

**** R API implementation keywords
The API keywords are either callbacks to the TIC-80 virtual machine---which can
be thought of as an operating system interface---or the user-facing API
functions. The following definitions are simply taken from the file =scheme.c=,
which implements the s7 Scheme integration, and the obvious changes made (Scheme
changed to R).

While [[https://github.com/nesbox/TIC-80/discussions/2100][in this GitHub discussion]] nesbox claims that one can simply place your
source files, with their respective langauge file suffixes, in "demos/" and the
build process will take care of generating a .tic.dat file, that doesn't appear
to be true [[https://github.com/nesbox/TIC-80/commit/87e91e7dd903dac7a9c232d1127a32b0d4a8dc54][given this commit]] and the inability for me to build solely due to
these files not being created automatically by a CMake build target. That's an
issue that will need to be opened.

After taking the time to understand the macros used in the definition of
RAPIKeywords, borrowed from SchemeAPIKeywords, I would /not/ bother to do it any
other way, as in the way Python or Janet did it. It is really, really neat. I
like this.

** DONE Registering symbols in R from C
CLOSED: [2024-10-19 Sat 22:01]
"Symbols need to be registered with R from C to be used in R," is what I wrote
to introduce this paragraph in its first draft; I'm not sure if registering
symbols is actually required, or what the purpose is. It might not be fully
relevant to my use of R. My appreciation of this topic, at the moment, is that
it is used to define new primites so that functions in R are automatically
defined to call registered C functions.

/Writing R Extensions/ documents how to register native routines with the
embedded R interpreter for later use from within R code. The objects =info=,
=cMethods=, and =callMethods= are desribed in turn in §8.1.3 of the documentation.
Only =cMethods= needs to be defined for the purposes of using R as a scripting
langauge for TIC-80 games.

#+name: example of registering native symbols
#+begin_src c
  DllInfo *info = R_getEmbeddingDllInfo();
  R_registerRoutines(info, cMethods, callMethods, NULL, NULL);
#+end_src

Native routines (symbols) registered with R get called through "the =.C=
interface," which is how R interacts with native routines when it is in control
of the main event loop. When embedded, and especially when not in control of the
main event loop, R needs to be told about native routines in a slightly
different manner, because R is not in control of loading shared libraries, /it
is the shared library/!

The symbols are the functions which enable scripting and wrap underlying C
routines that every scripting language API in TIC-80 hooks into. These symbols
are automatically made available to R when it is embedded in the application.
The function which performs the registration is built-in to R.

Presumably, all of these functions will then be available in R as functions
which have the given name (e.g. "tri") and would be callable with
~.External("tri")~.

** TODO The default cartridge
The demonstration (default) cartridge or ROM is a bunch of byte code included
from a =dat= file. The bytes are read directly into a =u8= array ~DemoRom[]~.
The =dat= file is created during build from =demos/rdemo.r=. Basing the file off
of the other demo files, I have written the usual TIC-80 "Hello, world!" in a
function style in R, and the contents of the metadata are identical to the Ruby
or Scheme demos (as every demo cartridge uses the same demo content by
convention).

- [X] Translate all cartridge assets during build.
- [ ] Ensure translation produces assets identical to what is already checked-in.
- [ ] Ensure parsing works when comments exist in the code.

The rest of the cartridge definition is metadata which embeds the graphics and
sounds into the cartridge. For now this is excluded because it isn't being
integrated correctly during build.

*** TODO Cartridge metadata
- [ ] The metadata is not stripped from the source code when loaded into the
  studio editor; this is a ~cart2prj~ issue, I think, which causes the studio
  editors to not have any data available (i.e. no sprites, map, etc.).

The metadata defined in paragraphs of source code comments provides the
cartridge loading mechanism the ability to retrieve the data component of the
"executable cartridge ROM".

** DONE Modifying =CMakeLists.txt= and writing CMake build generation files

* TODO Creating build assets at build-time from source files
- [ ] FIXME: the assets are not converted properly. MAYBE: the assets may be
  converted correctly, but the cloned build assets may be out of date compared
  to the demo file sources (which is why my .tic.dat files differ from existing
  ones when created from the assumedly same soures).

The is a build/assets directory in the TIC-80 sources containing DAT formatted
files which are needed to include benchmarks for various scripting language
integrations and also the demo and default cartridges for these langauges. The
Git repository for TIC-80 currently contains pre-built assets, and the upstream
GitHub hosted interface to that repository has workflows which will build these
assets at build time using a Windows BATCH script. That limited my ability to
develop for TIC-80, so after successfully compiling the build tools (prj2cart
and bin2txt) on Linux I wrote a BASH script to call these for all of the build
asset source files.

** DONE Convert assets to DAT formats (on UNIX-likes)
CLOSED: [2024-10-25 Fri 16:11]
This script can be used to convert build assets (particularly =rmark.r= and
=rdemo.r=) to the DAT format used by TIC-80 at runtime. It requires using the
the original, unedited versions of proj2cart and bin2txt. It will only work on
UNIX-likes, so a portable interface that will work on any development machine
motivated the edits in the next sextion.

A CMake file is used to construct the input arguments for the programs. These
programs are only available when TIC-80 is built with the option
~BUILD_TOOLS=ON~, in which case this target will be always be called when the
sources are out of date, which is determined when the CMake file is called.

Construct the list of demo and benchmark source files from a list of file type
suffixes for each supported language.

To make the necessary modifications to prj2cart and bin2txt I will create some
source blocks and extend the programs to support multiple input files and
specify an output directory rather than only support explicit input and output
file paths.

#+begin_src cmake :noweb-ref generate the tic.dat files
  add_custom_target(GenerateTicDatFiles
      ALL
      ## Generate .tic files in the CMAKE_BINARY_DIR directory using source files
      ## from the demos/ source directory.
      COMMAND prj2cart -i ${projects} -o ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}
      ## Convert the .tic files in the CMAKE_BINARY_DIR to .tic.dat and place the
      ## resulting file in the build/assets source directory.
      COMMAND bin2txt -zi ${cartridges} -o ${buildAssetDir}
      COMMENT "[DEMOS_AND_BUNNYS] Generating build assets (.tic.dat files)"
      COMMAND_EXPAND_LISTS)
#+end_src

This is great---and works!---but I need to loop over all of the project files
using the original tools because my tool edits are bugged in some small way that
I do not want to invest time into right now.
