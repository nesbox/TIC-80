## Brief overview
  Guidelines for organizing builds in TIC-80, specifying the standard location for build artifacts to maintain consistency across different build types.

## Build Location
  - Always build projects in the 'build' folder to keep build artifacts organized and avoid cluttering the source directory.

## Project-Specific Notes
  - Applies to all TIC-80 build configurations, including SDL, Sokol, and Emscripten builds.
